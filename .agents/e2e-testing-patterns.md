# E2E Testing Patterns

Comprehensive End-to-End testing guidelines for the Public Talk Planner project using Playwright.

## Core Testing Principles

- USE Playwright fixtures pattern for all reusable test utilities
- REQUIRE data-testid attributes on all interactive elements
- FOLLOW ESM module syntax exclusively
- IMPLEMENT component-first development workflow
- MAINTAIN test isolation and independence
- LEVERAGE Playwright's built-in features over custom solutions

## Mandatory Test Selector Strategy

### Requirements

- ADD data-testid attributes to ALL interactive elements during component development
- USE data-testid as primary selector strategy for all test locators
- NEVER use fragile selectors like CSS classes, element attributes, or text content
- APPLY consistent naming convention: `{feature}-{element}-{type}`

### Naming Convention

- USE kebab-case for all data-testid values
- STRUCTURE names hierarchically: `{feature}-{element}-{type}`
- PROVIDE context through feature prefix: `auth-email-input`, `talk-title-input`
- USE descriptive element names: `submit-button`, `cancel-button`, `email-input`
- INCLUDE type suffix when element type isn't obvious: `-input`, `-button`, `-menu`, `-dialog`

### When to Add Test IDs

- ADD data-testid during initial component implementation
- INCLUDE test IDs in component requirements from start
- VERIFY test ID presence before marking component complete
- DOCUMENT all test IDs in component file comments or props interface
- UPDATE test IDs when component structure changes significantly

### Why This Strategy

- STABILITY: Test IDs remain stable during refactoring, styling changes, or content updates
- CLARITY: Explicit test attributes separate testing concerns from implementation details
- MAINTAINABILITY: Clear naming convention makes test code self-documenting
- RELIABILITY: Eliminates false positives from CSS framework updates or translation changes

## Playwright Fixtures Pattern

### Core Requirements

- USE Playwright's `test.extend()` API for creating reusable test utilities
- ORGANIZE fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` directory
- IMPLEMENT Page Object Models as fixtures, not standalone classes
- COMBINE multiple fixture modules using `mergeTests()` and `mergeExpects()`
- EXPORT single `test` and `expect` from `tests/fixtures/index.ts`
- **ALWAYS** import `test` and `expect` from `tests/fixtures/index.ts`, NOT from `@playwright/test`

### Import Rules

```typescript
// ✅ Correct: Import from merged fixtures
import { test, expect } from "../fixtures"

// ❌ Wrong: Direct import from @playwright/test
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test"
```

Why This Matters:

- ENSURES all custom fixtures are available in tests
- PROVIDES enhanced functionality (e.g., automatic Nuxt hydration waiting)
- MAINTAINS consistent fixture behavior across all tests
- ENABLES centralized fixture configuration and updates

### Fixture Organization

- CREATE separate fixture files per feature domain
- NAME fixture files descriptively: `auth-fixtures.ts`, `talks-fixtures.ts`
- EXPORT fixture definitions from domain files
- MERGE all fixtures in `tests/fixtures/index.ts`
- IMPORT test and expect from merged fixtures in test files

Example Fixture Structure:

```
tests/
├── fixtures/
│   ├── index.ts              # Merged fixtures (import from here)
│   ├── auth-fixtures.ts      # Authentication utilities
│   ├── speakers-fixtures.ts  # Speaker management utilities
│   └── test-accounts.json    # Test user data
├── e2e/
│   ├── speakers.spec.ts      # Import { test, expect } from "../fixtures"
│   └── talks.spec.ts         # Import { test, expect } from "../fixtures"
```

### Fixture Lifecycle

- USE test-scoped fixtures for resources needing isolation between tests
- USE worker-scoped fixtures for expensive resources shared across tests
- LEVERAGE automatic setup and teardown capabilities
- AVOID manual cleanup in test files when fixtures can handle it
- IMPLEMENT fixture dependencies through Playwright's dependency injection

### Page Object Models as Fixtures

- IMPLEMENT Page Object Models (POMs) as fixture classes
- ENCAPSULATE page interactions within POM methods
- INJECT necessary fixtures (like page or authenticatedPage) as POM dependencies
- RETURN POM instances from fixture definitions
- ORGANIZE POM methods logically by user workflow

Example Page Object as Fixture:

```typescript
// speakers-fixtures.ts
import { test as base } from "@playwright/test"

class SpeakersPage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {}

  async goto() {
    await this.page.goto("/speakers")
  }

  async createSpeaker(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    await this.page.getByTestId("speakers-create-button").click()
    await this.page.getByTestId("speakers-first-name-input").fill(firstName)
    await this.page.getByTestId("speakers-last-name-input").fill(lastName)
    await this.page.getByTestId("speakers-submit-button").click()
  }
}

export const test = base.extend<{ speakersPage: SpeakersPage }>({
  speakersPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await use(new SpeakersPage(page))
  }
})
```

### Built-in Enhanced Fixtures

The project includes enhanced fixtures that extend Playwright's default behavior:

**Enhanced `page` Fixture:**

```typescript
// tests/fixtures/index.ts
export const test = base.extend({
  page: async ({ page }, use) => {
    // Override goto to wait for Nuxt hydration
    const originalGoto = page.goto.bind(page)
    page.goto = async (url, options) => {
      const response = await originalGoto(url, options)
      // Wait for Nuxt hydration to complete
      await page.waitForFunction(() => window.useNuxtApp?.().isHydrating === false)
      return response
    }
    await use(page)
  }
})
```

Why: Prevents race conditions with non-hydrated Nuxt components

**`authenticateAs` Fixture:**

```typescript
// tests/fixtures/index.ts
export const test = base.extend({
  authenticateAs: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await use({
      admin: async () => {
        await authenticateAs(page, "admin")
        await page.context().storageState({ path: ".auth/admin.json" })
      },
      talksManager: async () => {
        await authenticateAs(page, "editor")
        await page.context().storageState({ path: ".auth/talks-manager.json" })
      }
    })
  }
})
```

Usage in Tests:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "../fixtures"

test("admin can access dashboard", async ({ page, authenticateAs }) => {
  // Use authenticateAs fixture
  await authenticateAs.admin()

  // Enhanced page automatically waits for Nuxt hydration
  await page.goto("http://localhost:3000/dashboard")

  await expect(page.getByTestId("admin-dashboard")).toBeVisible()
})
```

### Why Fixtures Pattern

- AUTOMATIC SETUP/TEARDOWN: Playwright handles lifecycle management automatically
- TYPE SAFETY: Full TypeScript support with proper type inference
- DEPENDENCY INJECTION: Built-in pattern for providing test dependencies
- PARALLELIZATION: Fixtures respect Playwright's parallel execution model
- OFFICIAL PATTERN: Follows Playwright's recommended approach for test utilities
- NUXT INTEGRATION: Custom fixtures handle Nuxt-specific requirements (hydration, auth)

## ESM Module Requirements

### Import Syntax Rules

- USE `import` statements exclusively in all test files
- NEVER use `require()` in ESM context
- ADD `with { type: "json" }` assertion for all JSON imports
- FOLLOW project's `type: module` configuration
- USE dynamic `import()` for conditional module loading

### Why ESM Syntax

- PROJECT STANDARD: Codebase uses `type: module` in package.json
- CONSISTENCY: Matches frontend and backend module patterns
- TOOLING SUPPORT: Better support in modern JavaScript tooling
- SPECIFICATION COMPLIANCE: Follows ECMAScript module specification

## Component Development Rules

### Test-Ready Component Requirements

- INCLUDE data-testid attributes in initial component implementation
- ADD test IDs to all interactive elements: buttons, inputs, links, menus
- DOCUMENT test IDs in component file or props interface
- FOLLOW established naming convention for test IDs
- VERIFY test ID presence before considering component complete

### Interactive Element Identification

- IDENTIFY all user-actionable elements in component
- ADD data-testid to form inputs, submit buttons, cancel buttons
- ADD data-testid to navigation links, dropdown menus, dialogs
- ADD data-testid to dynamic content areas that tests will verify
- INCLUDE data-testid on parent containers when testing lists or groups

### Documentation Requirements

- DOCUMENT all data-testid values in component
- USE inline comments near elements with test IDs
- LIST all test IDs in component documentation block
- UPDATE documentation when adding or changing test IDs
- REFERENCE fixture integration requirements if applicable

### Why Component-First Approach

- EFFICIENCY: Eliminates retroactive updates to components
- CONSISTENCY: Ensures all components follow test ID convention
- PLANNING: Forces consideration of testing needs during development
- QUALITY: Improves component API design with testability in mind

## Working with Nuxt Hydration

### The Hydration Challenge

Nuxt applications use Server-Side Rendering (SSR), which means:

1. Server renders the initial HTML with data
2. Browser displays the static HTML
3. Vue "hydrates" the HTML (attaches event listeners, makes it interactive)
4. During hydration, components may not be fully interactive

### Race Condition Problem

```typescript
// ❌ Problem: Test may run before hydration completes
test("clicks button", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:3000/speakers")
  // Button exists in DOM but might not be interactive yet
  await page.getByTestId("speakers-create-button").click() // May fail!
})
```

### Solution: Enhanced Page Fixture

The project includes an enhanced `page` fixture that automatically waits for hydration:

```typescript
// tests/fixtures/index.ts
export const test = base.extend({
  page: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const originalGoto = page.goto.bind(page)

    // Override goto to add hydration waiting
    page.goto = async (url, options) => {
      const response = await originalGoto(url, options)

      // Wait for Nuxt hydration to complete
      await page.waitForFunction(() => window.useNuxtApp?.().isHydrating === false)

      return response
    }

    await use(page)
  }
})
```

### How It Works

1. Test calls `page.goto(url)`
2. Enhanced fixture navigates to the page
3. **Automatically waits** for `window.useNuxtApp().isHydrating === false`
4. Returns control to test when page is fully interactive
5. Test can safely interact with components

### Usage in Tests

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "../fixtures"

test("interacts with hydrated component", async ({ page }) => {
  // Enhanced page automatically waits for hydration
  await page.goto("http://localhost:3000/speakers")

  // Component is now fully hydrated and interactive
  await page.getByTestId("speakers-create-button").click()
  await expect(page.getByTestId("speaker-form-modal")).toBeVisible()
})
```

### Benefits

- **AUTOMATIC**: No manual waiting in test code
- **RELIABLE**: Eliminates race conditions with non-hydrated components
- **CONSISTENT**: All tests benefit from hydration waiting
- **TRANSPARENT**: Tests don't need to know about hydration mechanics

### When to Use Manual Waiting

In rare cases where you need to test the non-hydrated state:

```typescript
test("checks static HTML before hydration", async ({ page }) => {
  // Use direct page.goto without enhanced fixture
  const originalPage = await context.newPage()
  await originalPage.goto("http://localhost:3000/speakers")

  // Test static HTML immediately
  await expect(originalPage.getByTestId("speakers-list")).toBeVisible()
})
```

### Anti-Patterns

```typescript
// ❌ Don't add manual hydration waits in tests
test("bad approach", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:3000/speakers")
  await page.waitForFunction(() => window.useNuxtApp?.().isHydrating === false)
  // Redundant - enhanced fixture already does this
})

// ❌ Don't use arbitrary timeouts
test("worse approach", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:3000/speakers")
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000) // Flaky and slow
})

// ✅ Use enhanced fixture (automatic)
test("correct approach", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:3000/speakers")
  // Hydration complete - ready to interact
})
```

## Test Development Workflow

### Three-Step Process

1. IMPLEMENT component with data-testid attributes from start
2. CREATE or UPDATE fixtures for reusable patterns and Page Object Models
3. WRITE tests using fixtures and established test IDs

### Component Development Phase

- DESIGN component with testability in mind
- ADD data-testid to all interactive elements
- DOCUMENT test IDs in component file
- VERIFY component renders correctly with test IDs
- MARK component as test-ready

### Fixture Development Phase

- IDENTIFY reusable patterns in test scenarios
- CREATE or UPDATE fixture files for common utilities
- IMPLEMENT Page Object Models for complex page interactions
- MERGE new fixtures into central exports
- DOCUMENT fixture usage patterns

### Test Writing Phase

- IMPORT test and expect from merged fixtures
- USE established data-testid values for selectors
- LEVERAGE fixtures for authentication, navigation, common actions
- IMPLEMENT test scenarios using Page Object Models
- VERIFY tests run reliably and independently

### Why This Workflow

- PREVENTS REWORK: Components are test-ready before tests are written
- REDUCES DUPLICATION: Fixtures created based on actual test needs
- IMPROVES QUALITY: Clear separation between setup, action, and assertion
- MAINTAINS CONSISTENCY: Established patterns followed across all tests

## Test Isolation and Independence

### Isolation Requirements

- ENSURE each test can run independently in any order
- USE fixtures to provide fresh state for each test
- AVOID dependencies between test cases
- CLEAN UP test data using fixture teardown
- LEVERAGE Playwright's automatic browser context isolation

### State Management

- USE test-scoped fixtures for test-specific state
- RESET application state between tests when necessary
- AVOID relying on previous test outcomes
- IMPLEMENT proper authentication setup for protected routes
- CLEAR browser storage when state must be fresh

### Why Isolation Matters

- RELIABILITY: Tests pass consistently regardless of execution order
- DEBUGGING: Failures are easier to diagnose without cross-test dependencies
- PARALLELIZATION: Tests can run in parallel without conflicts
- MAINTAINABILITY: Tests remain independent when codebase changes

## Authentication Patterns

### Setup File Requirements

- CREATE authentication setup files in `tests/auth/` directory
- USE `test.use({ storageState })` for authenticated contexts
- AUTHENTICATE once per project using Playwright's authentication mechanism
- STORE authentication state in `.auth/` directory
- CONFIGURE different roles with separate setup files

### Authentication Fixtures

- CREATE authenticatedPage fixture for tests requiring authentication
- INJECT authentication state through fixture dependencies
- HANDLE authentication errors gracefully
- PROVIDE role-specific authenticated fixtures when needed

### Why Authentication Fixtures

- EFFICIENCY: Authenticate once, reuse across tests
- CONSISTENCY: Centralized authentication logic
- MAINTAINABILITY: Single source of truth for auth patterns
- PERFORMANCE: Faster test execution with shared authentication

## Performance Optimization

### Test Execution Speed

- USE worker-scoped fixtures for expensive setup
- SHARE authentication state across tests
- MINIMIZE unnecessary navigation and waiting
- LEVERAGE Playwright's parallel execution
- AVOID redundant API calls in test setup

### Resource Management

- CLEAN UP resources using fixture teardown
- REUSE browser contexts when appropriate
- AVOID creating unnecessary page instances
- IMPLEMENT efficient selector strategies
- USE test timeouts appropriately

### Why Performance Matters

- DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE: Faster feedback during development
- CI/CD EFFICIENCY: Reduced pipeline execution time
- COST: Lower resource consumption in CI environments
- SCALABILITY: Test suite grows without proportional slowdown

## Error Handling and Debugging

### Failure Diagnosis

- USE descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- IMPLEMENT meaningful error messages in assertions
- LEVERAGE Playwright's automatic screenshots on failure
- USE `test.step()` for complex test scenarios
- LOG relevant context when tests fail

### Debugging Strategies

- RUN tests with `--debug` flag for interactive debugging
- USE Playwright Inspector for step-by-step execution
- ENABLE trace recording for failed tests
- REVIEW automatic screenshots and videos
- CHECK browser console logs for errors

### Why Debugging Support

- EFFICIENCY: Faster issue resolution during test failures
- CLARITY: Understanding test failures without running locally
- MAINTENANCE: Easier updates when application changes
- CONFIDENCE: Better understanding of test coverage

## Quality Assurance

### Test Reliability

- VERIFY tests pass consistently across multiple runs
- AVOID flaky tests by using proper wait strategies
- USE Playwright's auto-waiting features
- IMPLEMENT appropriate timeout configurations
- TEST edge cases and error conditions

### Coverage Considerations

- TEST happy paths with common user workflows
- TEST error conditions and validation failures
- TEST authentication and authorization boundaries
- TEST responsive behavior across viewport sizes
- TEST accessibility requirements when applicable

### Why Quality Standards

- CONFIDENCE: Reliable tests provide accurate feedback
- MAINTAINABILITY: High-quality tests require less maintenance
- DOCUMENTATION: Tests serve as living documentation
- REGRESSION PREVENTION: Comprehensive tests catch regressions early
